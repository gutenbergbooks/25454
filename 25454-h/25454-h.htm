<div class="blurb">
<p><em>Pioneer railroading was dangerous. With increased speed
and density of traffic came an increase in catastrophic wrecks
that forced operators to take heed for the safety of their passengers
and freight. This safety was painfully achieved through
the slow process of improving equipment part by part.</em></p>

<p><em>Antedating such spectacular post-Civil War advances as the
steel rail, automatic coupler, and airbrake, was the invention
of the safety truck for locomotives. Intended to lead the
bobbing, weaving locomotive around curves on the rough track
of the early roads, it did much to reduce the all too numerous
derailments that were a major cause of accidents.</em></p>

<p class="firstword"><span>American railroads</span> of the early 19th century were
cheaply and hastily built. They were characterized
by inferior roadbeds, steep grades, sharp
curves, and rough track. In spring, poor drainage
and lack of ballast might cause the track to sink into
the soggy roadbed and produced an unstable path.
In winter this same roadbed could freeze into a hard
and unyielding pavement on which the rolling stock
was pounded to pieces.</p>

<p>In those pioneering times the demand for new roads
left little capital to improve or expand existing lines;
therefore equipment was needed that could accommodate
itself to the existing operating conditions.</p>

<p>The first locomotives used in this country had been
imported from England. Designed for well-ballasted
track with large-radius curves and gentle gradients,
they all too frequently left the rails, and the unsuitability
of the essentially rigid British design soon became
apparent.</p>

<p>The challenge posed by the American roadbed was
met by American mechanics. By the mid-1830&#8217;s
a distinctive American locomotive had evolved that
might best be described by the word &ldquo;flexible.&rdquo;
The basic features of its running gear were a bar
frame and equalizing levers to provide vertical relief
and a leading truck to provide lateral relief. Of
these devices the truck was probably the most important,
and more readily than any one component
distinguished the American running gear from that
used by the British before 1860.</p>

to the <cite>Brother Jonathan</cite>. This locomotive, one of the earliest to use a leading truck, was built in June 1832
by the West Point Foundry Association for the Mohawk and Hudson Rail Road. The truck is attached
to the locomotive frame by a center pin, but the forward weight of the locomotive is carried by a roller
which bears on the frame of the truck. (<cite>Smithsonian photo <span class="nw">36716-a</span></cite>)</p></div>

<p>It was John B. Jervis who is generally credited with
first applying the truck to the locomotive. His
design, shown in <a href="#f.1">figure 1</a>, was developed in 1831&ndash;32.
Its merits quickly became apparent, and by 1835 it
<a name="png.003" id="png.003"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">119</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>had been universally recognized in this country.
The truck successfully led the locomotive around
sharp curves, the resultant 3-point suspension enabled
the machine to traverse even the roughest of tracks,
and, altogether, the design did far less damage to the
lightly built U.S. lines than did the rigid, imported
engines.<sup><a href="#fn.1"
 name="fna.1" id="fna.1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The truck frame, fabricated from iron straps and
castings, was attached to the locomotive by a pin
around which it might rotate. At first the weight was
received by rollers or chafing pads mounted on the
side beams of the truck. However, the friction of
these bearing surfaces and their location at a considerable
distance from the center pin combined to restrict
the free movement of the truck. By the early 1850&#8217;s
the point of bearing was transferred to the center
plate, producing a truck that turned more freely.<sup><a href="#fn.2"

<p><span class="smc">Figure 3</span>.&mdash;Typical 4-wheel Bissell Safety truck of 1860. This drawing is based on plate 69 of Alexander L.
Holley&#8217;s, <cite>American and European Railway Practice in the Economical Generation of Steam</cite>, New York, 1861.
(<cite>Smithsonian photo 46946</cite>)</p>
</div>

<p>For single axle engines this simple form of truck
was entirely satisfactory, but it proved less satisfactory
for 4- and 6-coupled machines. Also, as train speeds
increased, so did the number of derailments. Many
of these could be traced to the inability of the engine
to negotiate curves at speed. Levi Bissell, a New
York inventor who investigated this problem in the
1850&#8217;s, correctly analyzed the difficulty. He observed
that when the engine was proceeding on
straight tracks the leading truck tended to oscillate and
chatter about the center pin, and he noted that it was
this action that imparted a fearful pitching motion
to the locomotive at speed. The derailments were
traced to the action of the truck as the engine
entered a curve.</p>

<p>This action can be more easily understood from
reference to Bissell&#8217;s patent drawing in <a href="#f.2">figure 2</a>. For
example, let us say that an 8-wheel engine, fitted with
a center-swing truck, enters a right-hand curve.
The left truck wheels bear hard against the left rail.
The drivers jam obliquely across the track, with the
right front and left rear wheels grinding into the rails.
As a result, the locomotive tends to leave the track in
the direction of the arrow shown on the figure (bottom
drawing). It will be noted that the truck center
pintle is in fact the fulcrum for this leverage. Under
such strain the truck wheels are particularly likely
to leave the rails when they encounter an obstruction.
Once derailed, the truck would then spin around on
the deadly center pin, throwing the locomotive over.</p>

<p>In effect, then, the center pin of the conventional
truck extended the rigid <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original has 'wheel-base'">wheelbase</ins> of the engine,
and caused the truck to act much as would a single
set of leading wheels fitted rigidly to the engine frame
far ahead of the front driving wheels. Bissell proposed
to correct the faults of the conventional truck by
fitting the locomotives with his invention, the first
practical safety truck to be patented. Since the
primary requirements were to keep the leading wheel
axles at right angles to the rails whether on a straight
or curved track, and to allow the driving axles to
remain parallel, or nearly so, to the radial line of the
curve, he moved the center pin to a point behind
the truck and just in front of the forward driving
axle. This shortened the wheelbase of the engine
and removed the danger of the pintle serving as a
fulcrum between the truck and the driving wheels,
thus allowing them to assume a comfortable position
on a curve.</p>

<p>Since the truck could assume the correct angle
when entering curves, it was claimed in the patent
specification that, unless all four wheels were simultaneously
<a name="png.006" id="png.006"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">122</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>lifted off the track, the truck could pass over
&ldquo;quite a considerable obstruction.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.3"
 name="fna.3" id="fna.3">3</a></sup> Bissell further
claimed:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>In running on either a straight or curved track one of the
truck wheels often breaks off, and the truck swivels around
on its center pin in consequence, and throws the engine
off the track, but with my device one wheel, or even the
two wheels on the opposite sides diagonally of the truck
might break off and still the truck would not run off,
because its position is set and it has no axis of motion around
which it could swing&hellip;.</p>

Hinkley Locomotive Works. From Gustavus Weissenborn, <cite>American Locomotive Engineering and Railway
Mechanism</cite>, New York, 1871, pl.&nbsp;88.</p>
</div>

<p>The other problem Bissell wished to correct was
the oscillation and chatter of the leading truck.
This was accomplished by a simple centering device
in the form of a pair of <span class="sans">V</span>-shaped double incline
planes (D on <a href="#f.3">fig.&nbsp;3</a>) situated at the center of the truck
frame (A). The lower planes of the pair were fastened
to the truck frame and the upper, cast in the form of
a bridge, were attached to the locomotive frame (C)
by a center plate. But while the portion of the
locomotive&#8217;s weight assigned to the leading wheels
was borne at the center of the truck, as in the
conventional design, the center plate was no longer
the point of rotation. On a straight track the <span class="sans">V</span>&#8217;s
would be at their bottom position and thus prevent
the truck from vibrating.<sup><a href="#fn.4"
 name="fna.4" id="fna.4">4</a></sup> When the locomotive
entered a curve the planes allowed its forward weight
to bear continuously on all four wheels, and at the
same time controlled any exaggerated swing caused
by centrifugal force.</p>

<p>The centering device is thus explained in the patent
specification (figure numbers are omitted):</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>I therefore obviate this difficulty [the oscillation of the
truck] by providing two inclined planes &hellip; formed double
as shown and of an angle proportioned to the weight of
the forward part of the locomotive and the velocity of the
same&hellip;. The position of the inclines is such that the
blocks [<span class="sans">V</span>&#8217;s] rest in the lowest part of the double inclines
when the engine is on a straight track, and on coming onto
a curve the inertia of the engine &hellip; is expended in going
up the inclines, as the truck moves laterally toward the
inner part of the curve; and on coming onto a straight line

engine is prevented from acquiring a sidewise or oscillating

</div>

<p>Bissell applied for a U.S. patent on April 23, 1857.
His petition was initially denied. A weary debate of
several months duration followed between the patent
examiner and Bissell&#8217;s attorneys.</p>

<p>During this time Bissell was busy promoting the
application of his truck even though he had no patent
for protection. In May of 1857 he showed a working
model of his improvement to Gilbert M. Milligan,
secretary of the Central Railroad Company of New
Jersey.<sup><a href="#fn.5"
 name="fna.5" id="fna.5">5</a></sup> Samuel L. Moore, master mechanic of that
railroad, also inspected the model. Both were so
impressed that it was decided to fit the device to the
locomotive <cite>Lebanon</cite>, which at the time was undergoing
repairs at the road&#8217;s Elizabeth Port, New Jersey,
shops.<sup><a href="#fn.6"
 name="fna.6" id="fna.6">6</a></sup> Although the engine was less than 18 months
old, her tires were badly worn and she oscillated at
high speed.</p>

<p>Early in June of that year a series of tests were
held with the <cite>Lebanon</cite>. Moore said of these trials:<sup><a href="#fn.7"
 name="fna.7" id="fna.7">7</a></sup></p>

<div class="quote">
<p>After the said invention of Bissell had been applied the
engine was run out onto a curve which she turned apparently
with nearly as much facility as she would travel on a straight
line, and the forward part of the engine rose on the inclines
as the truck entered the curve and remained fixed while
running around said curve and then resumed its former
position on entering a straight track, and the trial was
pronounced by all who saw it as most satisfactory, even by
those who before pronounced that it would be a failure.</p>

<p>At a subsequent trial under a full pressure of steam and a
velocity of about thirty miles per hour the entering and
leaving the curve was equally satisfactory, the same being
accurately observed by a man located on the cow catcher.</p>

<p>&hellip; The engine was run at its greatest possible velocity
at least forty miles per hour on a straight track and the
previous &ldquo;shaking of the head&rdquo; [oscillation] was found to
be entirely overcome, and the engine run as steadily as a
car would have done&hellip;.</p>

<p>At one of the trials a bar of iron 3/4 × 4 inches was spiked
down across one of the <i>rails diagonally of the track</i>, &hellip; and
the employees of the company took the precaution to fill
in around the track to facilitate getting the engine back
again, supposing she must jump off; however on passing
over slowly she still kept the track and the speed was
increased until she passed over said bar &hellip; while under a
considerable speed.</p>
</div>

<p><ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'Messers.'">Messrs.</ins> Moore and Milligan heartily endorsed the
truck as a complete success. Milligan predicted
that<sup><a href="#fn.8"
 name="fna.8" id="fna.8">8</a></sup> &ldquo;the time is not far distant when locomotives
will be considered incomplete and comparatively
unsafe without this improvement particularly on
roads which have many curves.&rdquo;</p>

impressed by the evidence of the New Jersey trials,
reinforced by the arguments of Bissell&#8217;s attorneys,
that he agreed to grant a United States patent.<sup><a href="#fn.9"
 name="fna.9" id="fna.9">9</a></sup> It
was issued as no. 17913 on August 4, 1857, and
reissued October 18, 1864 as no. 1794. British patent
1273 had been issued earlier (May 5, 1857), and
patents were also secured in France, Belgium, Austria,
and Russia.</p>

<p>The Rogers Locomotive Works in 1858 was one of
the earliest builders to apply the improved truck. By
1860 they had fitted many of their engines with it and
were endorsing the device to prospective customers.</p>

<p>In the same year the <cite>American Railway Review</cite> noted
that the truck was in extensive use, stating:<sup><a href="#fn.10"
 name="fna.10" id="fna.10">10</a></sup></p>

<div class="quote">
<p>&hellip; the advantages of the arrangement are so obvious and
its results so well established by practice in this country
and Europe that a treatise on its principles will hardly be
needed.</p>

<p>It is no longer an experiment; and the earlier it is applied
to all engines, the better the running and repair accounts
will look.</p>
</div>

<p>The success of Bissell&#8217;s invention prompted others
to perfect safety trucks for locomotives. Alba F.
Smith came forward in 1862 with the simple substitution
of swing links (<a href="#f.4">fig.&nbsp;4</a>) for the incline planes.<sup><a href="#fn.11"
 name="fna.11" id="fna.11">11</a></sup>
A swing-bolster truck had been developed 20 years
earlier for use on railroad cars,<sup><a href="#fn.12"
 name="fna.12" id="fna.12">12</a></sup> and while Smith
recognized this in his patent, he based his claim on
the specific application of the idea to locomotive
trucks. That the swing links succeeded the incline
planes as a centering device was mainly because they
<a name="png.009" id="png.009"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">125</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>were cheaper and simpler to construct, and not, as
has been claimed, that the <span class="sans">V</span>&#8217;s wore out quickly.<sup><a href="#fn.13"
 name="fna.13" id="fna.13">13</a></sup></p>

</div>

<p>Smith&#8217;s swing-bolster truck, with the heart pendant
link, a later refinement, became the dominating form
of centering devices and was used well into this century.
It was to be superseded in more recent years
by the constant resistance and gear roller centering
devices which, like Bissell&#8217;s invention, depended on the
double incline plane principle.</p>

<p>The British-born engineer William S. Hudson,
superintendent of the Rogers Works and an early
proponent of the Bissell truck, in 1864 obtained a
patent<sup><a href="#fn.14"
 name="fna.14" id="fna.14">14</a></sup> for improving Bissell&#8217;s safety truck. Hudson
contended that since the Bissell arrangement had
a fixed pivot point it could traverse only one given
radius accurately. He proposed to replace the fixed
pivot with a radius bar (see <a href="#f.5">fig.&nbsp;5</a>) one end of which
was attached to the locomotive under the smoke-box
and the other to rear of the truck frame, at the same
point of attachment as in the Bissell plan. Thus,
according to Hudson, the pivot point could move
laterally so that the truck might more easily accommodate
itself to a curve of any radius. He further
claimed that a better distribution of weight was
effected and that the use of the radius bar relieved
the center bearing casting of much of the strain of
propelling the truck.</p>

</div>

<p>The British journal <cite>Engineering</cite>, in an article otherwise
friendly to the inventor, expressed some skepticism
as to the real merit of Hudson&#8217;s invention.<sup><a href="#fn.15"
 name="fna.15" id="fna.15">15</a></sup></p>

<div class="quote">
<p>If Mr. Hudson&#8217;s truck, &hellip; be examined, it will be seen
that the radius link serves no other purpose than that of
carrying the truck along with the engine, and this could
obviously be equally done by the pivot or central pin of
the truck itself.</p>
</div>

<p>It is probable that few builders other than Rogers
made use of the Hudson radial link.<sup><a href="#fn.16"
 name="fna.16" id="fna.16">16</a></sup> One of these
was John Headden, whose <cite>General Darcy</cite>, shown in
<a href="#f.6">figure 6</a>, was fitted with the Hudson truck.</p>

<p>Thus, by 1860 there had been perfected and
adopted a successful 4-wheel safety truck for <span class="nw">4-4-0&#8217;s</span>
and <span class="nw">4-6-0&#8217;s</span> used in general mixed and passenger
service. But as the decade advanced, the need grew
for heavy freight engines that could be safely run at
speed. Without a pilot truck, the leading driving
axle of the freight engine was generally overloaded.
While the application of a 4-wheel truck reduced this
front-end overload and permitted faster running it
materially reduced the traction of the drivers by
bearing too great a portion of the total weight. This
loss of traction was of course highly undesirable and
generally disqualified the use of 4-wheel trucks for
freight engines. What was needed was a truck which
would guide the <span class="nw">0-6-0&#8217;s</span> and <span class="nw">0-8-0&#8217;s</span> around curves
and yet leave the greater portion of the weight on the
drivers. The 2-wheel, or pony, truck met these
requirements.<sup><a href="#fn.17"

</div>

<p>Levi Bissell produced the basic patent for such
a truck in 1857. Zerah Colburn in September of
that year had suggested to Bissell that he develop a
2-wheel truck. Such a device, he believed, would
be well received in Britain.<sup><a href="#fn.18"
 name="fna.18" id="fna.18">18</a></sup> He was quite correct,
as will shortly be seen.</p>

<p>In nearly every respect Bissell&#8217;s 2-wheel truck (see
<a href="#f.7">fig.&nbsp;7</a>) followed the idea of the original patent for the
4-wheel truck, which he claimed as the basis for the
present invention. The pintle was located behind
the truck axle, near the front driving-wheel axle,
and the weight was carried by incline planes that
also served as the centering device.</p>

<p>A study of the patent drawing in <a href="#f.7">figure 7</a> reveals
several interesting points. Note that the <span class="sans">V</span>&#8217;s, and
thus the point of bearing, are slightly in front of the
center line of the truck axle. It was suggested in the
patent specification that the <span class="sans">V</span>&#8217;s might be placed to
the front, rear, or directly over the axle, but in most
actual applications they were placed directly over the
axle. Note also that the locomotive shown on the figure
is obviously a standard high-wheel American type
which has suffered the rather awkward substitution
of a pony truck for its regular 4-wheel arrangement.
It is probable that few if any American types were so
rebuilt.</p>

<p>Bissell was granted U.S. patent 21936 on November
2, 1858. British patent 2751 was issued for the same
device on December 1, 1858. A few months later, in
the summer of 1859, service tests of <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original has 'Bissel&#8217;s'">Bissell&#8217;s</ins> new truck
began in England.</p>

<p>First known use of the truck was on the British Eastern
Counties Railway <cite>No.&nbsp;248</cite>, a rigid-frame <span class="nw">2-4-0</span>
built by Kitson in 1855. The leading wheels of the
engine, as originally constructed, were attached to the
frame in the same manner as the drivers and thus had
<a name="png.012" id="png.012"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">128</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>no lateral freedom. For the test the front pedestals,
which held the journal boxes of the leading wheels,
were cut off and a Bissell pony truck was substituted.
About a year later Alexander L. Holley reported on
the success of the test.<sup><a href="#fn.19"
 name="fna.19" id="fna.19">19</a></sup> The 248 had operated
17,500 miles, at speeds up to 50&nbsp;m.p.h., safely and
satisfactorily. The engine not only rode more
steadily but showed a remarkable reduction in flange
wear. The road was so pleased that by 1866 they
had equipped 21 locomotives with Bissell trucks.<sup><a href="#fn.20"
 name="fna.20" id="fna.20">20</a></sup>
Several other British lines followed the example of the
Eastern Counties Railway.</p>

<p>At first Bissell&#8217;s 2-wheel truck received wider application
in Europe than in this country, because most
American roads, despite the interest in developing
heavier freight locomotives, continued to depend
upon the <span class="nw">4-4-0</span> as a dual-purpose machine. It was
not until after 1870, when Mogul and Consolidation
types appeared in greater numbers, that the 2-wheel
truck became common in the United States.</p>

<p>The first use, known to the writer, of the Bissell
pony in this country occurred in November or December
of 1859 on the Memphis and Charleston
Railroad. D.&nbsp;H. Feger, master mechanic of the
railroad reported, eight months later, that since the
locomotive had been fitted with the Bissell truck
&ldquo;she has never left the rail and previous to her having
this truck she was off the rail almost daily.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.21"

</div>

<p>The Baldwin Locomotive Works in December 1860
built a group of rather awkward looking <span class="nw">2-6-0&#8217;s</span> for
the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. Equipped
with Bissell trucks, these were undoubtedly among the
very first new locomotives to be so built. The first
consolidation type was built by Baldwin in 1866; it
was equipped with a 2-wheel Bissell safety truck.</p>

<p>The Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works and
the New Jersey Locomotive and Machine Works,
both of Paterson, New Jersey, in the early 1860&#8217;s
began building Moguls; these are known to have had
Bissell trucks. Other builders followed their example,
so that by the 1870&#8217;s 2-wheel trucks had become
relatively common.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the 2-wheel truck was not
an absolute success until it was equalized with the
front driving axle. This arrangement was perfected
in 1864 by William S. Hudson, but before describing
his invention it will be helpful to discuss several earlier
attempts to equalize pony trucks with the drivers.</p>

<p>In 1857 John P. Laird, then master mechanic of
the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad, rebuilt an old
Niles 8-wheeler into a curious <span class="nw">2-6-0</span> on which only
the two rear driving wheels were coupled. The front
driver was driven by a chain and sprocket, and the
pilot wheels were equalized with the front driving
axle. The success or failure of the arrangement has
not been definitely determined, but whatever the
outcome, Laird continued his experiments when he
became superintendent of motive power for the
Pennsylvania Railroad in 1862. He abandoned the
chain drive for a more conventional arrangement of
side rods, but the truck and his plan of equalization
were much the same as that tried earlier. Laird
used two equalizing levers, attached at one end to the
front spring hangers and at the other to the truck,
<a name="png.014" id="png.014"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">130</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>but in a way to allow the truck to swing horizontally.
The fulcrum for each lever was mounted on the
underside of the front frame rail. A number of old
8-wheel Baldwin flexible-beam engines and several
<ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'Winan&#8217;s'">Winans&#8217;</ins> Camels were rebuilt in this way. One of
these is shown in <a href="#f.8">figure 8</a>. Laird, however, eventually
became dissatisfied with his arrangement and re-equipped
the engines with Bissell trucks.</p>

Gazette</cite>, March 3, 1876.</p>
</div>

<p>John L. Whetstone on April 10, 1860, obtained
U.S. patent 27850, which strikingly anticipated the
plan Hudson was to develop four years later.<sup><a href="#fn.22"
 name="fna.22" id="fna.22">22</a></sup>
Whetstone did not use a Bissell truck and was in fact
more concerned in relieving the excess weight, often
a 50% overload, from the front axle of <span class="nw">0-6-0</span>
locomotives and in distributing a portion of that
weight to a pony truck. His arrangement may be
readily understood from the patent drawing in <a href="#f.9">figure
9</a>. Probably the best features of the design was the
transverse H-beam that connected the spring hangers
to the truck frame, which in this case also served as
the equalizing lever (note that the ball &ldquo;C&rdquo; acts as
the fulcrum).</p>

<p>Hudson made use of this same device but in a more
practical manner. He found that while the Bissell
pony truck could satisfactorily adjust itself laterally
and could lead the locomotive around curves, it could
not handle the varying loads imposed upon it by the
rough trackage typical of American railroads. At one
moment an undue amount of weight would fall upon
the truck because the drivers were over a depression
in the roadbed. This condition overloaded the truck&#8217;s
springs and also resulted in a momentary loss of
adhesion, causing the drivers to slip. Conversely,
when the truck hit a depression too much weight was
thrust upon the driving wheels, and broken springs
or other damage might result.</p>

<p>Hudson&#8217;s ingenious remedy to this problem was
simple and straightforward (see <a href="#f.10">fig.&nbsp;10</a>). A heavy
equalizing lever that connected the truck to the
springs of the front driving wheels was placed on
the longitudinal centerline of the locomotive, with the
fulcrum under the cylinder saddle. Thus the truck
and front driver reacted together to all the inequalities
and shocks offered by the roadbed.</p>

Company. Probably some fault was found
with the suspension of these machines, numbered 35
and 36, for the next <span class="nw">2-6-0</span>, numbered 39, built for

equalizer. This engine, completed in January 1865,
is believed to be the first Mogul so equipped.<sup><a href="#fn.23"
 name="fna.23" id="fna.23">23</a></sup></p>

<p>The Locomotive Engine Safety Truck Company
(see <a href="#f.11">fig.&nbsp;11</a>) was formed in the 1870&#8217;s, with A.&nbsp;F.
Smith as president, to exploit the patents of Bissell,
Smith, and Hudson. For several years notices
appeared in the columns of the <cite>Railroad Gazette</cite> reporting
suits by the Company against various railroads
and locomotive builders for unauthorized use
of their patents. The <cite>Gazette</cite> of May 29, 1875,
carries a protest of the Company against the Manchester
Locomotive Works for unlicensed use of
Smith&#8217;s patent of 1862. In the issue of August 28,
1875, is reported the Company&#8217;s success in establishing
the validity of Smith&#8217;s patent:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Some important settlements for the use of the patent have
lately been made with the company, one of them being with
the Western Railroad Association, whose headquarters are
at Chicago, which includes the principal western roads.
Through this the company receives its royalty on several
hundred locomotives.</p>
</div>


<h3>IN SUMMARY</h3>

<p>It can be stated that Hudson&#8217;s modification of the
Bissell truck is of unquestioned importance, for without
the introduction of the equalizer it is doubtful if
the 2-wheel pony truck would have been a complete
success on American railroads. Bissell&#8217;s 4-wheel
truck was extensively employed, but it did not enjoy
the universal popularity of the 2-wheel truck, and in
the 1880&#8217;s was eclipsed by other forms of 4-wheel
safety trucks. The Hudson-Bissell pony truck, however,
survived in its basic form to recent times, when,
in the late 1940&#8217;s and early 1950&#8217;s, the last steam
locomotives were constructed in this country.</p>

Zerah Colburn, <cite>Locomotive Engineering and the Mechanism of
Railways</cite>, &hellip;, London, 1871, p.&nbsp;99. Zerah Colburn (1832&ndash;1870)
was one of the best informed and most vocal authorities
on 19th-century American locomotive construction. He not
only designed advanced machines while working at the New
Jersey Locomotive Works but also advocated many reforms in
locomotive design. He published the <cite>Railroad Advocate</cite> in
New York City for several years. In 1858 he became editor
of <cite>The Engineer</cite> and in 1866 founded the technical journal
<cite>Engineering</cite>.</p>

Whetstone was chief designer for Niles &amp; Co., a Cincinnati
locomotive builder. His invention apparently did not receive
a test, since the company closed shortly before the patent was
granted. No other builder seemed interested.</p>
